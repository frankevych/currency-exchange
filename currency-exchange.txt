The application has 2 pages and a top bar navigation. The order of items in the navigation is not
important.
The first page is a currency calculator. It enables selection of currencies and entering the
amount which is recalculated using the median exchange rate. 
The second page is a list/table which shows current exchange rate (buying, selling and median)
for all available currencies.
The application should be responsive (mobile/tablet/desktop).
A REST API is available at the following URL: http://hnbex.eu/api/ v1/
The documentation does not contain this, but if you need, you can send **from** and **to**
query parameters to get rates in a date range - http://hnbex.eu/api/v1/rates/EUR/? from=2017-11-1&to=2017-11-06
We want to see how you think and solve problems. 
You should use React for the solution, but can also use any other third party libs (e.g. for state management, UI, ...). 
I hope you’ll find an assignment interesting and that you’ll use it to show us what you know.
